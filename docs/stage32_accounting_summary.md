## 2. Contributing Source Membership and Version-Pinned Rights Inheritance

> **Authoritative Rights Notice:**  
> Licence labels shown in Stage 32 are descriptive only. The authoritative rights decision is the exact `rights_profile_id` and `rights_profile_version` inherited from `stage-31-complete-v8`.

### Multi-Level Membership Reconciliation
- Distinct lexicon entries: 1,010
- Entry-source memberships: 1,194
- Entries occurring in multiple sources: 138 (124 in 2 sources, 14 in 3 sources)
- Entries occurring in a single source: 872
- Included token occurrences: 3,668
- Missing rights-profile references: 0
- Unregistered contributing sources: 0

$$\sum_{e=1}^{1010}|	ext{contributing sources}_e|=1,194$$

Do not sum the five source-specific entry counts directly into "1,010 distinct entries." The sum represents 1,194 entry-source memberships across 1,010 distinct lexicon entries.
